# Assets Folder

This folder is for source assets that may need processing before being used in the application.

## Purpose

- Store original, high-resolution images before optimization
- Keep design files (Figma exports, PSD files, etc.)
- Store assets that need to be processed or converted

## Workflow

1. Add your original assets here
2. Process/optimize them as needed
3. Copy optimized versions to `/public/images/` for use in the application

## Notes

- Files in this folder are NOT served by Next.js
- Use this for source files and working assets
- Keep processed/optimized files in `/public/images/`
